#### Introduction

> The world's first traffic light dates back to 1868.
> It was installed in London to control traffic for... horse-drawn vehicles!
> Today, traffic lights can be found at street intersections in almost every city in the world,
> making it safer for vehicles to go through them.
> Traffic lights have at least two states, and use one color (usually red) to signal "stop",
> and another (usually green) to signal that cars can proceed through.
> The very first traffic lights were manually controlled.
> Nowadays they are automatic, meaning that they have to be carefully designed and
> timed in order to optimize the overall travel time for all the participants in traffic.
